    <h4>Are you ready to walk?</h4>
    
    <p> Your sneakers are going to be your best friend in NYC. Get ready to walk, start your
    day earlier because there is much to see! If you like to take pictures you should consider how heavy the camera is,
if you are going to walk. Don't forget your water!</p>

    <h4> Lets talk about chargers!</h4>
    
    <p>
Have you heard of portable chargers? It is helpful to walk with your phone charger or wireless charger. 
Many places in New York have outlets, but many do not work. 
Parks like Bryant Park have outlets and chargers for public use, if you walk along Sixth Avenue and 42 Street. </p>

    <h4> Always have a B plan!</h4>
    
    <p> It is never advisable to go for a walk with all of your cash. Although this may sound silly, you should always have a "Plan B" when it comes to money.
  Check with your bank to see if you can make a duplicate credit or debit card. Go out with one, and leave the other in the hotel or room.</p>
